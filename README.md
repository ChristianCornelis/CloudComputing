# CloudComputing
Repo for a Cloud Computing ourse taken at U of G in the Winter of 2020.

## A1
### Task 1
In both AWS and Azure, do the following in Python or Jupyter Notebooks:
  - Create containers named CIS1300, CIS3110, and CIS4010
  - Populate the containerswith the following objects
  - Using this object store, write an interactive Python/Jupyter Notebooks program that displays the objects in 
    1. All containers
    2. Aspecified container
    3. With a specified name in any of the containers (i.e. must search all containers)
    4. For a specified object, downloads that object to a file (on the client system) using the same name as the object

### Task 2
Create a NoSQL table with the Movies information available in JSON format in the file, moviedata.zip, on the CourseLink site.
Write an interactive Python/Jupyter Notebooks program that will use the Movies database to allow a user to do the following type of queries and then chose to save the displayed results to a csvfile.
Query and display parameters
  - Partition and/or sort key (individual value or range of values)
  - Filter by any attribute
  - Sort by key or attribute
  - Only display certain attributes

### Task 3
Compare the two implementations for both Task 1 and Task 2. Cover aspects such as implementation, performance, permissions, available documentationand tutorials, etc. Also provide a reference list of any resources used to do Tasks 1 and 2

### Task 4
For all aspects that you needed to use for the implementation, create a user manual that
  a) explains each procedure used in AWS and maps it to the equivalent procedure in Azure, along with an explanation of that Azure procedure;
  b) identifies any aspect of either AWS or Azure that does not easily map to one in the other cloud service.
  
## A2
Automate deployment of VMs to either an AWS or Azure platform.  On these VMs you can also load multiple Docker images and start some of them.  Your goal is to make this as close to a one-click action as possible.
